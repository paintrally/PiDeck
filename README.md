#### Trigger Springs

--NOTE-- Ignore the wire thickness in the Assembly Drawing, it is incorrect. I will fix it when I next need to make changes. Correct thickness listed here.
These guys have a lot of different options, they are pretty cheap so I'd grab a few different wire thicknesses
and test them out to see what you like. You need about 2mm ID on the coil section, so look for an ID of at least double the wire
thickness greater than 2mm. I found 0.4mm to feel a bit too thin, and 0.7mm is about the limit of the trigger supports so 0.5-0.6mm is probably the sweet spot.

#### Trigger Magnets

You'll never need fridge magnets again!

#### RGB Lights

You'll need both RGB LED's and WS2811 IC's if you're adding RGB to your controller PCB's.
These are the LED's I used. Any alternative in the same sized package should be fine too, just be cautious of
differing pin configurations.

WS2811 IC's:

#### Screws

Here's a list of the screws required for assembly. This list is also in the assembly instructions. SCHS is just a standard allen key head screw. CSK is a countersunk head screw. Most bolt suppliers should have these, otherwise ebay or aliexpress is your friend.

12x M3x6mm SHCS
2x M2x16 CSK
9x M2x5 CSK
14x M2x4 SHCS
