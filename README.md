#### Display

As a display, I used a Amazon fire 8 HD 8th generation (also known as the 2018 edition). While this doesn't seem the best choice of display for this project, you can get them for cheap on sites like ebay and I already had it on hand!

This is a certified refurbished one (2022 model) off amazon as they don't sell the 2018 one anymore.
